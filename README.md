 Find points of interest
 
 This is the project I made for my final year of Computing course at the University of Greenwich. It consists of an Android mobile application that allows users to find points of interest around and along a preselected route. The user can find point of interests (such as restaurant, ATMs, hospitals, petrol stations, police stations, museums ...) around his/her location or along a preselected route. The user can find the fastest route between point A and point B and customize the research of points of interest by chosing the radius of action and, also, the accuracy of the research.
 Once a place has been found, the user can select the marker of the map and a "compass" will appear to show in with direction the person needs to walk o=in order to reach the place and how far it is.
